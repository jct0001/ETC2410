TBD:
- refer to commented pdf for edits. Some comments will require Jonas to fix it himself or interpret what he means
- change question format to reflect criteria
- label all final equations with a number to reflect criteria
- q1f part iv i need you to change to reflect the updated equation (previous equation was wrong as harry pointed out)
- pls update the eviews for q1f to reflect the new equation
- q2 change the use of the word "equation" to "property"
- Jonas needs to do q3 (c)
- Jonas needs to fix that one question in (q1) that has MATHSPEAK on it 

After TBD is completed, the final review is as follows:
- check each qu so that equations naturally follow
- code is done correctly and Eviews returns correct output
- check that the structure of the doc aligns with assignment criteria
- ensure all members have submitted (as this is a requirement)
- everyone do feedback
- check names and student id is on the doc
